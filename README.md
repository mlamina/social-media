# üì¢ AI-Assisted Social Media Posts

This project uses [PR Pilot](https://www.pr-pilot.ai) to help create and manage social media content across various platforms.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

All content is organized in the following structure:

- `posts/README.md` - A table of contents for all posts
- `posts/<post-slug>/draft.md` - Source content for the social media post
- `posts/<post-slug>/<platform>/post.md` - Generated post for the platform
- `posts/<post-slug>/<platform>/meta.md` - Generated meta data for the post (e.g., tags, channels)

In [prompts/platform-instructions](prompts/platform-instructions), you will find instructions for generating posts 
on each platform. Adjust them as needed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

Generating a new post is easy

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new Draft
