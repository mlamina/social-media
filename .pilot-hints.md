This project uses PR Pilot to help create social media content.
The user provides "source content" in the form of a markdown file, 
and PR Pilot generates social media posts for various platforms.

## Project Structure

All content is organized in the following structure:
- `posts/README.md` - A table of contents for all posts
- `posts/<post-slug>/source.md` - Source content for the social media post
- `posts/<post-slug>/<platform>/post.md` - Generated post for the platform
- `posts/<post-slug>/<platform>/meta.md` - Generated meta data for the post (e.g., tags, channels)

### Post Structure
The structure of each post is as follows:
```markdown
# Meta

<platform-specific meta info like tags, channels, etc>

# Post

<generated post content>
```

- `x` - X
- `linkedin` - LinkedIn
- `facebook` - Facebook
- `devto` - DEV Community
- `reddit` - Reddit
