This project uses PR Pilot to implement a social media content pipeline.
From an initial draft, a DEV.to article is generated, which contains the main post.
Secondary posts are generated for other platforms and linked back to the original post.

## Pipeline Stages

The pipeline has three stages:
1. **Draft** - Drafts are stored as Markdown files in the `drafts` directory.
2. **Generate** - From the draft, a DEV.to blog post is generated.
3. **Review** - The generated post is reviewed and edited before being published.
4. **Publish** - The post is published on the DEV Community platform.
5. **Distribute** - Secondary posts for other platforms are generated, linked to the original post, and published.

## Project Structure

All content is organized in the following structure:
- `drafts/` - Contains all draft content
