## Remember the first time you saw an LLM write code?

![Whoa](https://media1.tenor.com/m/wS9gJkWOuecAAAAC/coroca-keanu-reeves.gif)

Yeah, I remember too. üò≤

When I learned **I could use this technology to build things**, I got pulled into an endless stream of ideas and side projects - The kind of excitement I hadn‚Äôt felt in years. I started experimenting with small scripts and had tasted blood. **I wanted more**.

## **The Gap**
The LLM-based tools at the time (mid 2023?) were powerful, but not tailored to my workflow. Sure, ChatGPT could answer questions, and GitHub CoPilot could generate code. But **I needed something that was more integrated**, something that understood not just my code but also my tools and daily routines. Something I could control from the CLI and with config files. **Something that speaks my language**. üñ•Ô∏è

## **The Turning Point at Work** üíº
As the technical lead of a team of 12, my little side project started to change how I viewed our workflows. **I saw inefficiencies everywhere** ‚Äî especially in large teams. Big orgs (we are but one of many teams) are **a maze of systems and isolated knowledge pools** that we all have to navigate to get our jobs done.

We have source control in one place, ticketing systems in another, CI/CD pipelines elsewhere, and internal knowledge **scattered across multiple platforms**. On top of that, **each team member has unique needs**. QA engineers, DevOps, junior devs, senior devs ‚Äî everyone has their own way of working and different environments.

## **Shaping PR Pilot for Real-World Teams**
To be useful for the average team in my organization, **the ideal assistant would have to navigate these complexities seamlessly**. It couldn‚Äôt just generate code or assist with a single task ‚Äî it had to connect the dots across different roles and workflows. It needed to act as **a bridge between siloed information and team-specific processes**.

This realization shaped PR Pilot into what it is today: a tool for developers, QA engineers, DevOps, and everyone in between. It‚Äôs designed to integrate with your specific workflows and **help you get work done faster**.

## **Why I Built PR Pilot**
PR Pilot is now an AI-powered assistant that integrates with GitHub, ticketing systems, and chat platforms to **streamline workflows** and reduce **context switching**. My mission? To help developers **stay in the flow** by providing the right assistance at the right time with minimal friction. üöÄ

It‚Äôs been a wild ride from hacking together scripts to launching a full-fledged product. If you‚Äôve ever felt bogged down by **manual tasks** or that **context switching** is killing your productivity, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts or ideas. Maybe PR Pilot can help make your dev life smoother too. üëá
