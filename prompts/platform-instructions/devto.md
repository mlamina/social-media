### How to write a dev.to article
- Make it coherent and throw out stuff that seems redundant
- People have short attention spans. Highlight important (parts of) phrases in bold, so I can scan the text quickly and understand the gist of it
- Use emojis to make it more engaging visually
- Add placeholders for any other content you think I should add, like gifs, videos, code, etc
